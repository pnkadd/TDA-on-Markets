We propse two indicators based on TDA (Wasserstein distance and L^p norm of persistence landscape) which are correlated with the volatilty index of stocks. When they are high there is a high chance that the market will crash.

The graphs of the indexes are in the main file titled TDA.ipnyb, as you see spikes correlate to market crashes. In the same file but lower cells there is also a comparison with stocks in the EU which shows as a sample how to paste different data in the code. 

The data that was used in the code was dowloaded from yahoo finance, you can very easily download your own data as long as you have the stock returns and run the rest of the code as is

The code for the wasserstein distance (Wasserstein.ipnyb) and the persistence landscapes (P_Landscapes.ipnyb) has been separated. The code for the landscapes runs slightly faster so if you only need this see the landscapes file otherwise refer to the wasserstein distance file. 

There is also a .pdf file which has a presentation on the topics and contains some short bullet points explaining the background theory and results
