We propse two indicators based on TDA which are correlated with the volatilty index of stocks. When they are high there is a high chance that the market will crash.

For the code above all text files (not ending in .ipnyb) can be run by copying and pasting the code in colab.

The graphs of the indexes are in the main file titled TDA.ipnyb, as you see spikes correlate to market crashes. In the same file there is also a comparison with stocks in the EU which shows as a sample how to paste different data in the code. 

The data that was used in the code was dowloaded from yahoo finance, you can very easily download your own data as long as you have the stock returns and run the rest of the code as is

The code for the wasserstein distance (Wasserstein Distance code) and the persistence landscapes (Persistence Landscapes code) has been separated. The code for the landscapes runs slightly faster so if you only need this see the landscapes file otherwise refer to the wasserstein distance file. The main file titled US stock indices has all the code in one file and there is a .ipnyb version that is titled TDA.ipny which should run on here 

The code ending in .ipnyb can be run directly and Wasserstein.ipnyb contains only the wasserstein distance calculation and similiarly for P_Landscapes.ipnyb which contains the code for the persistence landscapes
